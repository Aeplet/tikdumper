# tikdumper
Nintendo Wii ticket (tik) dumper.

# What is this?
This is an application to dump [tickets](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Ticket) from your Wii console. 

# How do I use this?
You just need any method of booting homebrew. In most cases this would be the Homebrew Channel. This app can be ran via an exploit (such as BlueBomb, BannerBomb, Wilbrand, LetterBomb, etc) too, as an IOS exploit is performed for elevation/setting registers. I am not sure which IOS versions this may not work on, as I've only tested this application with IOS58.
